 You're so wise. You're like a miniature Buddha, covered in hair. 


 Uh-oh. She pointed to her boobies. 
 I immediately regret this decision. 
Hello? Who's there, I'm talkin? Hello? Who is this? Baxter... is that you? Baxter! Bark twice if your in Milwaukee... Is this Wilt Chamberlain? Have the courage to say something! Hello? 
 Good night, I'm Ron Burgundy. Go fuck yourself San Diego. 
 How now brown cow. 
 The arsonist had oddly shaped feet. 
 Unique New York. 
 Oh, Baxter, you are my little gentleman. I'll take you to foggy London town 'cause you are my little gentleman. Wow, this burrito is delicious, but it is filling. 
 Policia! 
 In case we die here today, there's something that you should know. That dirty trick with the Teleprompter. It wasn't... 
 You woke up the bears! Why did you do that? 
 What did you say? 
 
 Fantastic! 
 Mmmmm... I look good. I mean really good. 
 Sharp broadcast all of you. Great show, especially from you on the floor. A lot of hustle. I liked that. 
 Ribs. I had ribs for lunch, that's why I'm doing this. 
 Ron Burgundy. Stay classy, San Diego. Hello, Baxter? Baxter, is that you? Bark twice if you're in Milwaukee. Is this Wilt Chamberlain? Have the decency to say something. 
 Hey, Aqualung. 
 Little Ham 'n Eggs comin' at ya, hold on people hope ya got your griddles... 
 Look, the most glorious rainbow ever. 
 This is your doctor. I have your pregnancy report here, and guess what. You got knocked up. 
 1001... 1002... 1003... 
 You know I don't speak Spanish. 
 You *bitch*! 
 Great Odin's raven! Veronica, she put that in the teleprompter. 
 She... Sh... It's terrible. She has beautiful eyes, and her hair smells like cinnamon. 
 YOU CAN USE MY OFFICE AND AFTERWARDS, MAYBE WE CAN GO TO LUNCH. 
 No, no, no, no, Brick. 
 You stay classy, Planet Earth. 
 Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight / Gonna grab some afternoon delight / My motto's always been, "When it's right, it's right" / Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night? 
 When everything's a little clearer in the light of day / And we know the night is always gonna be there anyway. 
 Sky rockets in flight / Afternoon delight. 
 Afternoon delight. 
 Afternoon delight. 
 ... Sky rockets in flight. Afternoon deliiiight... Ahh... I make fart-noises with my mouth, and I like it cause... 
 Don't act like you're not impressed. 
 Hit 'em in the uvula! 
 I'm on right now?... I don't believe you. 
 It's all right, my sweet chinchilla. 
 You've got a dirty whorish mouth. 
 I'm gonna shoot you with a BB gun when you're not looking. Yep, back of the head. 
 You're a real hooker. I'm gonna slap you in public. 
 I'll have three fingers of Glenlivet, with a little bit of pepper... and some cheese. 
 I freakin' love you. 
 A La Jolla man clings to life at a University Hospital after being viciously attacked by a pack of wild dogs in an abandoned pool. 
 Agree to disagree. 
 And a tip of the cap to you, Miss Corningstone. 
 And I'm Ron Burgundy. Go fuck yourself, San Diego. 
 And I'm Ron Burgundy. You're a dirty bitch, San Diego. 
 And I'm Tits... I'm Ron Burgundy. 
 and see if she likes the goods. 
 Antony and Cleopatra! 
 Big deal. I am very professional. 
 Boy, that escalated quickly... I mean, that really got out of hand fast. 
 Brian, I'm gonna be honest with you, that smells like pure gasoline. 
 Brick, are you just looking at things in the office and saying that you love them? 
 Brick, are you saying that there's a party in your pants and that I'm invited? 
 Brick, I've been meaning to talk to you about that. You should find yourself a safehouse or a relative close by. Lay low for a while, because you're probably wanted for murder. 
 Brick, My sweet Brick. Brick, come hug me! I know you want to. 
 Brick, where did you get a hand grenade? 
 By the beard of Zeus! 
 By the beard of Zeus. 
 Cannonball! 
 Certainly. 
 Como estan, beetches? 
 Did Brian tell you to say this, Brick? 
 Did I say that loud? 
 Discovered by the Germans in 1904, they named it San Diego, which of course in German means a whale's vagina. 
 Do you guys really want to know what love is? 
 Do you really love the lamp, or are you just saying it because you saw it? 
 Doesn't it mean Saint Diego? 
 Don't you know I'd never say fuck. Fuck. 
 Dorothy Mantooth is a Saint! 
 Ed, I've got to fire you. 
 Everyone just relax, all right? Believe me, if there's one thing Ron Burgundy knows, it's women. 
 Excuse me? No touching of the hair or face... AND THAT'S IT!  
 Excuse me. 
 Excuse me... excuse me... what are you doing? 
 Excuse me... is that 'sex panther' you're wearing? 
 For just one night let's not be Co-workers. Let's be Co-people. 
 For the entire Channel 4 news team, I'm Veronica Corningstone. 
 For the entire Channel 4 news team, I'm Veronica Corningstone. 
 Garth, if I would give you some money out of my wallet, would that ease the pain? 
 Get out! Just go! We are through. Through! Because of your actions, you *scorpion* woman! 
 Go easy on her, guys, she has feelings too, you know. 
 God no, it smells like, like a used diaper... filled with... Indian food. Oh, excuse me. 
 Good evening, San Diego. I'm Veronica Corningstone. Tits McGee is on vacation. 
 Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy and here's what happening in your world tonight. 
 Great Odin's raven. 
 Great story. Compelling, and rich. 
 Guess what, I do. I know that one day Veronica and I are gonna to get married on top of a mountain, and there's going to be flutes playing and trombones and flowers and garlands of fresh herbs. And we will dance till the sun rises. And then our children will form a family band. And we will tour the countryside and you won't be invited. 
 Hey everyone! Come see how good I look! 
 Hey Garth. How's the divorce? 
 Hey, let's leave the mothers out of this. 
 Hey, this is me - Papa Burgundy. As far as I'm concerned Corningstone's fair game. Let the games begin. Wey-ho. Wey-ho. 
 How are you? You look awfully nice today. Maybe don't wear a bra next time... No, I was talking to you. No, not her. I don't know her name. What is it? Lanolin? Lanolin? Like sheep's wool? 
 I can't believe that I cared for you. 
 I can't believe you *did* this to me! You read my news! 
 I didn't know that the Salvation Army was having a sale? 
 I don't know how to put this but I'm kind of a big deal. 
 I don't normally do this, but I felt compelled to tell you something. You have an absolutely breath-taking... heiney. I mean, that thing's good. I wanna be friends with it. 
 I freakin' love you back. 
 I hate you, Ron Burgundy. I hate you. 
 I love poetry, and a glass of scotch, and, of course, my friend Baxter here. 
 I love scotch. Scotchy, scotch, scotch. Here it goes down, down into my belly... 
 I need this machine so I can watch a tape for a story. 
 I said... your hair... looks stupid. 
 I saw that. Brick killed a guy. Did you throw a trident? 
 I thought you were kidding! I thought it was a joke! I even wrote it down in my diary, "Veronica had a very funny joke today!" I laughed at it later that night! 
 I told you that I wanted to be an anchor. I told you that. 
 I wanna polka. 
 I wanna say something. I'm gonna put it out there; if you like it, you can take it, if you don't, send it right back. I want to be on you. 
 I will have you know that I have more talent and more intelligence in my little finger than you do in your entire body, sir. 
 I'm a man who discovered the wheel and built the Eiffel Tower out of metal and brawn. That's what kind of man I am. You're just a woman with a small brain. With a brain a third the size of us. It's science. 
 I'm expressing my inner anguish THROUGH THE MAJESTY OF SONG! 
 I'm gonna punch you in the ovary, that's what I'm gonna do. A straight shot. Right to the babymaker. 
 I'm in a glass case of emotion. 
 I'm not a baby, I am a man. I am an anchorman. 
 I'm pretty sure that's not love. 
 I'm proud of you fellas. You all kept your head on a swivel, and that's what you gotta do when you find yourself in a vicious cock fight. 
 I'm sorry, I was trying to impress you. I don't know what it means. I'll be honest, I don't think anyone knows what it means anymore. Scholars maintain that the translation was lost hundreds of years ago. 
 I'm storming your castle on my steed, m'lady. 
 I'm using the tape. I'm showing Jeffrey my Emmy tape. We are watching history. 
 I'm very important. I have many leather-bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany. 
 If you want to throw down fisticuffs, fine. I've got Jack Johnson and Tom O'Leary waiting for ya, right here. 
 It did, didn't it? 
 It's a formidable scent... It stings the nostrils. In a good way. 
 It's an old expression. 
 It's quite pungent. 
 It's so damn hot... milk was a bad choice. 
 Jazz flute is for little fairy boys. 
 Knights of Columbus, that hurt. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, can I please have your attention. I've just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story. I need all of you, to stop what you're doing and listen. 
 Last time I looked in the dictionary, my name's Ron Burgundy. What's your name? 
 Let's dance, dickweed. 
 Let's go over the groundrules. Rule number 1
 Let's go to Brian Fantana who's live on the scene with a Channel 4 News exclusive. Brian? 
 May I take your order? 
 Mr. Harken, this city needs its news. And you are going to deprive them of that because I have breasts? Exquisite breasts? Now, I am gonna go on, and if you want to try and stop me, bring it on. Because I am good at three things
 Mr. Harkin, I just wondering if you knew when my office would be ready. 
 My God, what is that smell? Oh. 

 OH!
THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!

You'll be on y our way up!
You'll be seeing great sights!
You'll join the high fliers
who soar to high heights.

You won't lag behind, because you'll have the speed.
You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead.
Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the best.
Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.

Except when you don't.
Because, sometimes, you won't.

I'm sorry to say so
but, sadly, it's true
that Bang-ups
and Hang-ups
can happen to you.

You can get all hung up
in a prickle-ly perch.
And your gang will fly on.
You'll be left in a Lurch.

You'll come down from the Lurch
with an unpleasant bump.
And the chances are, then,
that you'll be in a Slump.

And when you're in a Slump,
you're not in for much fun.
Un-slumping yourself
is not easily done.

You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.
Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're darked.
A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go in?
How much can you lose? How much can you win?

And IF you go in, should you turn left or right...
or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not quite?
Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find,
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind.

You can get so confused
that you'll start in to race
down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace
and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild space,
headed, I fear, toward a most useless place.
The Waiting Place...

...for people just waiting.
Waiting for a train to go
or a bus to come, or a plane to go
or the mail to come, or the rain to go
or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow
or the waiting around for a Yes or No
or waiting for their hair to grow.
Everyone is just waiting.

Waiting for the fish to bite
or waiting for the wind to fly a kite
or waiting around for Friday night
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.
Everyone is just waiting.

NO!
That's not for you!

Somehow you'll escape
all that waiting and staying
You'll find the bright places
where Boom Bands are playing.

With banner flip-flapping,
once more you'll ride high!
Ready for anything under the sky.
Ready because you're that kind of a guy!

Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.
And the magical things you can do with that ball
will make you the winning-est winner of all.
Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can be,
with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.

Except when they don't
Because, sometimes they won't.

I'm afraid that some times
you'll play lonely games too.
Games you can't win
'cause you'll play against you.

All Alone!
Whether you like it or not,
Alone will be something
you'll be quite a lot.

And when you're alone, there's a very good chance
you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants.
There are some, down the road between hither and yon,
that can scare you so much you won't want to go on.

But on you will go
though the weather be foul.
On you will go
though your enemies prowl.
On you will go
though the Hakken-Kraks howl.
Onward up many
a frightening creek,
though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak.

On and on you will hike,
And I know you'll hike far
and face up to your problems
whatever they are.

You'll get mixed up, of course,
as you already know.
You'll get mixed up 
with many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
and remember that Life's 
a Great Balancing Act.
Just never foget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.

And will you succeed?
Yes! You will, indeed!
(98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)

KID, YOU'LL MOVE MOUNTAINS!

So...
be your name Buxbaum or Bixby or Bray
or Mordecai Ali Van Allen O'Shea,
You're off the Great Places!
Today is your day!
Your mountain is waiting.
So...get on your way!


 No, no. No, I did it. 
 No, that's - that's what it means. Really. 
 No, there's no way that's correct. 
 No. No. 
 Nope! 
 Oh Audrey - I look like hell! I got bags under my eyes. What's that? Well if you were a man, I'd punch you. Punch you right in the mouth. That's bush. Bush league. YOU HEAR ME? AUDREY! LOOK AT ME! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Alright? 
 Oh Ron, there are literally thousands of other men that I should be with instead, but I am 72 percent sure that I love you. 
 Oh, did I? 
 Oh, Miss Corningstone. I wasn't expecting company. Just doing my workout. Tuesday's arms and back. 
 Oh, uh, it's the pleats... the pleats in the pants. It's an optical illusion. I was just about to take them back... to the pants store. Oh this is embarrassing. 
 Oh, we're going there. 
 Oh, well, when in Rome. 
 Oh! I've never heard of it. It's wonderful, though. 
 Oh. Do me on it. 
 Ohh, it's the deep burn. Oh, it's so deep. Oh, I can barely lift my right arm 'cause I did so many. I don't know if you heard me counting. I did over a thousand. 
 Okay. No. I don't want to go to a party in your pants. 
 Oop... I almost forgot. I won't be able to make it fellas. Veronica and I trying this new fad called uh, jogging. I believe it's jogging or yogging. it might be a soft j. I'm not sure but apparently you just run for an extended period of time. It's supposed to be wild. 
 People know me. 
 Really? What was her name? 
 Really. 
 Son of a bee-sting. 
 Sweet Eli Whitney's nose. It wasn't you, was it? It was Wes Mantooth! Oh, I should have known
 Sweet Lincoln's mullet. 
 Take me to Pleasure Town. 
 Thank you, Scott. 
 That doesn't make sense. 
 That's a given. 
 That's not a good start, but keep going... 
 The arsonist has oddly shaped feet. 
 The following is based on actual events. Only the names, locations and events have been changed. 
 The human torch was denied a bank loan. 
 The intimate times? Outta sight, my man. 
 The only way to bag a classy lady is to give her two tickets to the gun show... 
 This is pathetic. 
 This is Ron Burgundy, proudly reporting once again for Channel 4 News. Today's story is one of the more remarkable things ever to happen to San Diago or even the world. But in order to properly retell it, I'm going to need some help from my co-anchor, Miss Veronica Corningstone. 
 Today we spell "redemption"... R-O-N. 
 Tonight's top story
 Uh, do as the Romans do? 
 Uh, I'll take a Manhattan, and kick the vermouth in the side with a pair of steel-toed boots. 
 Uh, Mr. Burgundy? Helen said that you needed to see me. 
 Um, Brick, before I let you go, are you still having your celebrity golf tournament? 
 Uncle Jonathan's corn-cob pipe. 
 Veronica Corningstone and I had sex, and now we are in love! 
 Very good. 
 Wait, Veronica, please tell me this is some kind of sick tasteless joke. 
 Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I... I wanna be on you. 
 We are laughing and we are very good friends. Good buddies sharing a special moment... 
 We have a saying in my country - the coyote of the desert likes to eat the heart of the young and the blood drips down to his children for breakfast, lunch and dinner and only the ribs will be broken 
 Well done sir. 
 Well, I could be wrong, but I believe diversity is an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era. 
 Well, I'm very happy for you. 
 Well, is it a shortcut or not? 
 Well, you asked me to come by, sir. 
 Well, you have bad hair. 
 What are you doing? 
 What, you guys can't say one thing? Even the guy that can't think said something. You guys just stand there? Come on. 
 What? Were you saying something? Look, I don't speak Spanish. 
 What? You pooped in the refrigerator? And you ate the whole... wheel of cheese? How'd you do that? Heck, I'm not even mad; that's amazing. How 'bout we get you in your p.j.'s and we hit the hay. 
 Why don't you go back to your home on Whore Island? 
 Wow. Never ceases to amaze me. What cologne you gonna go with? London Gentleman, or wait. No, no, no. Hold on. Blackbeard's Delight. 
 Wow. Quite a drink order. 
 Yes, I am going to have three fingers of Glenlivet with a little bit of pepper, and, uh, some cheese. 
 Yes? Please, go on. 
 Yes? What is it, Brick? 
 Yes. 
 You are a smelly pirate hooker. 
 You are not a man. You are a big fat joke. 
 You dirtbags have been in third place for five years. 
 You eat that cat *poop*! 
 You guys have it, I think. 
 You have broken my heart, Mr. Burgundy. You have broken my heart. 
 You look like a blueberry. 
 You stay classy, San Diego. 
 You stay classy, San Diego. I'm Ron Burgundy? 
 You wanna dance, Burgundy? 
 You weren't here. Why are you being this way? Why can't you just be proud of me as a peer and my gentleman lover? 
 You're pathetic. 
 ...and that can be very distracting. Okay, so when we get to the pet shop... 
 ...laughing and enjoying our friendship, and someday we'll look back on this with much fondness. 



I love scotch. Scotchy, scotch, scotch. Here it goes down, down into my belly

The sun did not shine. It was too wet to play. So we sat in the house All that cold, cold, wet day. 
I sat there with Sally, we sat there we two. And I said, “How I wish we had something to do!” Too wet to go out and too cold to play ball. So we sat in the house. We did nothing at all. So all we could do was to Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! And we did not like it. Not one little bit. And then something went BUMP! How that bump made us jump! We looked! Then we saw him step in on the mat! We looked! And we saw him! The Cat in the Hat! And he said to us, “Why do you sit there like that?” “I know it is wet And the sun is not sunny. But we can have lots of good fun that is funny!” “I know some good games we could play,” Said the cat. “I know some new tricks,” Said the Cat in the Hat. “A lot of good tricks. I will show them to you. Your mother Will not mind at all if I do.” Then Sally and I Did not know what to say. Our mother was out of the house For the day. But the fish said, “No! No! Make that cat go away! Tell that Cat in the Hat you do NOT want to play. He should not be here. He should not be about. He should not be here When your mother is out!” “Now! Now! Have no fear. Have no fear!” said the cat. “My tricks are not bad,” Said the Cat in the Hat. “Why, we can have lots of good fun, if you wish, With a game that I call UP UP UP with a fish!” “Put me down!” said the fish. “This is no fun at all! Put me down!” said the fish. “I do NOT wish to fall!” “Have no fear!” said the cat. “I will not let you fall. I will hold you up high as I stand on a ball. With a book on one hand! And a cup on my hat! But that is not ALL I can do!” said the cat... “Look at me! Look at me now!” said the cat. “With a cup and a cake on the top of my hat! I can hold up TWO books! I can hold up the fish! And a little toy ship! And some milk on a dish! And look! I can hop up and down on the ball! But that is not all! Oh, no. That is not all... “Look at me! Look at me!

One fish, Two fish, Red fish, Blue fish,
Black fish, Blue fish, Old fish, New fish.
This one has a littlecar.
This one has a little star.
Say! What a lot of fish there are.
Yes. Some are red, and some are blue.
Some are old and some are new.
Some are sad, and some are glad,
And some are very, very bad.
Why are they sad and glad and bad?
I do not know, go ask your dad.
Some are thin, and some are fat.
The fat one has a yellow hat.
From there to here,
From here to there,
Funny things are everywhere.
Here are some who like to run.
They run for fun in the hot, hot sun.
Oh me! Oh my! Oh me! oh my!
What a lot of funny things go by.
Some have two feet and some have four.
Some have six feet and some have more.
Where do they come from? I can't say.
But I bet they have come a long, long way.
we see them come, we see them go.
Some are fast. Some are slow.
Some are high. Some are low.
Not one of them is like another.
Don't ask us why, go ask your mother.

One, two, three...
How many fingers do I see?

Who am I? My name is Ned
I do not like my little bed.
This is no good. This is not right.
My feet stick out of bed all night.
And when I pull them in, Oh, Dear!
My head sticks out of bed up here!

We like our bike. It is made for three.
Our Mike sits up in back, you see.
We like our Mike, and this is why:
Mike does all the work when the hills get high.

Hello there, Ned. How do you do?
Tell me, tell me what is new?
How are things in your little bed?
What is new? Please tell me Ned.
I do not like this bed at all.
a lot of things have come to call.
A cow, a dog, a cat, a mouse.
Oh! What a bed! Oh! What a house!

Oh dear, oh dear! I cannot hear.
Will you please come over near?
Will you please look in my ear?
There must be something there, I fear.
Say look! A bird was in your ear.
But he is out. So have no fear.
Again your ear can hear, my dear.

My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My shoe is off, my foot is cold.
My shoe is off, my foot is cold.
I have a bird I like to hold.
My hat is old, my teeth are gold.
And now my story is all told.

We took a look. We saw a Nook.
On his head he had a hook.
On his hook he had a book.
On his book was "How to Cook"
We saw him sit and try to cook
But a Nook can't read, so a Nook can't Cook.
SO...
What good to a Nook is a hook cook book?

the moon was out and we saw some sheep.
We saw some sheep take a walk in their sleep.
by the light of the moon, by the light of a star;
They walked all night from near to far.
I would never walk. I would take a car.

I do not like this one so well.
all he does is yell, yell, yell.
I will not have this one about.
When he comes in I put him out.
This one is quiet as a mouse.
I like to have him in the house.

At our house we open cans.
We have to open many cans.
and that is why we have a Zans.
A Zans for cans is very good.
Have you a Zans for cans? You should.

I like to box. How I like to box.
So every day I box a Gox.
In yellow socks I box my Gox.
I box in yellow Gox box socks.

It is fun to sing if you sing with a Ying.
My Ying can sing like anything.
I sing high and my Ying sings low.
And we are not too bad, you know.

this one, I think, is called a Yink.
he likes to wink, he likes to drink.
He likes to drink, and drink, and drink.
the thing he likes to drink is ink.
The ink he likes to drink is pink.
He likes to wink and drink pink ink.
SO...
If you have a lot of ink,
you should get a Yink, I think.

Hop, hop, hop! I am a Yop
All I like to do is hop,
From finger top to finger top.
I hop from left to right and then...
Hop, hop! I hop right back again.
I like to hop all day and night.
From right to left and left to right.
Why do I like to hop, hop, hop?
I do not know. Go ask your Pop.

Brush, brush, brush, brush
Comb, comb, comb, comb
Blue hair is fun to brush and comb.
All girls who like to brush and comb,
Should have a pet like this at home.

Who is this pet? Say! He is wet.
You never yet met a pet, I bet,
As wet as they let this wet pet get.

Did you ever fly a kite in bed?
did you ever walk with ten cats on your head?
Did you ever milk this kind of cow?
Well, we can do it. We know how.
If you never did, you should.
These things are fun, and fun is good.

Hello, hello. Are you there?
Hello! I called you up to say hello.
I said Hello.
Can you hear me, Joe?
Oh no, I cannot hear your call.
I cannot hear your call at all.
This is not good, and I know why.
A mouse has cut the wire, goodbye!

From near to far, from here to there,
Funny things are everywhere.
These yellow pets are called the Zeds.
They have one hair upon their heads.
Their hair grows fast. So fast they say,
They need a haircut every day.

Who am I? My name is Ish
On my hand I have a dish.
I have this dish to help me wish.
When I wish to make a wish
I wave my hand with a big swish swish.
Then I say, "I wish for fish!"
And I get fish right on my dish.
So...
If you wish to make a wish,
you may swish for fish with my Ish wish dish.

At our house we play out back.
We play a game called ring the Gack.
Would you like to play this game?
Come down! We have the only Gack in town.

Look what we found in the park in the dark.
We will take him home, we will call him Clark.
He will live at our house, he will grow and grow.
Will our mother like this? We don't know.

And now, Good night.
It is time to sleep
So we will sleep with our pet Zeep.
Today is gone. Today was fun.
Tomorrow is another one.
Every day, from here to there.
funny things are everywhere.
Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You're off to Great Places!
You're off and away!

You have brains in your head.
You have feet in your shoes.
You can steer yourself 
any direction you choose.
You're on your own. And you know what you know.
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.

You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with care.
About some you will say, "I don't choose to go there."
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of feet, 
you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street.

And you may not find any
you'll want to go down.
In that case, of course,
you'll head straight out of town.

It's opener there
in the wide open air.

Out there things can happen
and frequently do
to people as brainy
and footsy as you.

And then things start to happen,
don't worry. Don't stew.
Just go right along.
You'll start happening too.
